# Challenges and Approach in Developing the Louder Project

## Overview
The Louder project is a web application designed to scrape and display event data from external sources. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend leverages Next.js for a modern and responsive user interface. This document highlights the challenges faced during development, the approaches taken to overcome them, and potential areas for improvement.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. Writing the Scraper Logic Using Puppeteer
One of the most significant challenges was implementing the web scraper using Puppeteer. The scraper needed to:
- Navigate to the Eventbrite website.
- Extract event details such as title, date, location, and price.
- Handle dynamic content loading and ensure data accuracy.

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Event data was often loaded asynchronously, requiring careful handling of page waits and selectors.
- **Selector Changes**: The structure of the Eventbrite website occasionally changed, breaking the scraper logic.
- **Performance**: Running the scraper efficiently without overloading the server or being flagged as a bot was a constant concern.

#### Solutions:
- Used Puppeteer's `waitForSelector` and `evaluate` methods to handle dynamic content.
- Implemented robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for missing or changed selectors.
- Set a realistic user agent and used Puppeteer's `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-setuid-sandbox` flags to improve compatibility and performance.

### 2. Scheduling the Scraper with Node-Cron
Another challenge was automating the scraper to run periodically using the `node-cron` library. The goal was to ensure the database remained up-to-date with the latest event data.

#### Issues Encountered:
- **Concurrency**: Ensuring that multiple scraper instances did not run simultaneously, potentially causing data inconsistencies.
- **Error Recovery**: Handling failures gracefully and retrying failed jobs.

#### Solutions:
- Used a cron schedule to run the scraper every six hours (`0 */6 * * *`).
- Added logging to monitor scraper runs and identify issues quickly.
- Ensured idempotency in database updates by using MongoDB's `updateOne` with the `upsert` option.

## Improvements and Future Work

### 1. Enhance Scraper Resilience
- Implement a monitoring system to detect and alert on scraper failures.
- Use a headless browser service like Playwright for better cross-browser compatibility.

### 2. Optimize Database Operations
- Introduce indexing in MongoDB to speed up queries and updates.
- Use a connection pool to manage database connections more efficiently in a serverless environment.

### 3. Improve Deployment
- Address potential issues with serverless environments (e.g., Vercel) by reusing database connections across function invocations.
- Add environment-specific configurations to handle differences between local and production setups.

## Conclusion
Developing the Louder project presented several technical challenges, particularly in web scraping and task scheduling. By leveraging Puppeteer and Node-Cron, we successfully implemented a robust solution. However, there is room for improvement in terms of resilience, performance, and deployment practices. These enhancements will ensure the project remains scalable and maintainable in the long term.
